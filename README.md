# ðŸ“˜ Tweetbook

**Tweetbook** is a school project demonstrating the development of a secure and modular RESTful API using **PHP** and **MySQL**. The application focuses on key backend principles such as user authentication, structured routing, and secure data handling.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**  
  Registration, login, and token-based session management.

- **RESTful API Design**  
  Clean, modular, and resource-oriented routing for full CRUD support.

- **Data Security**  
  Input validation, password hashing, and prepared SQL statements to prevent injection attacks.
